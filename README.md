# Natural Language Understanding Assignments

This brief Python module has example of code used to understand dependency parsers, in this case the one provided by [spaCy](https://spacy.io/)

A description of the main functions can be found in the wiki of this repository, organized by assignment.

### Requirements

This Python project requires the following:

- [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) which is an open-source software library for Natural Language Processing
- [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) a python module that implements pseudo-random number generators
- [assignment_module_1](assignment_module_1.py) which is the python file that implements the assignment 1.
- [assignment_module_2](assignment_module_2.py) which is the python file that implements the assignment 2.
- [conll script](conll.py) Is necessary in order to properly execute functions in [assignment_module_2](assignment_module_2.py)

### Installation

**spaCy**: We advise referring to the official documentation regarding proper installation [here](https://spacy.io/usage#installation).

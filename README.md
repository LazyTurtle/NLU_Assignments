# Natural Language Understanding Assignments
## Assignment 1

This brief Python module has example of code used to understand dependency parsers, in this case the one provided by [spaCy](https://spacy.io/)

A description of the main functions can be found in the wiki of this repository.

### Requirements

This Python project requires the following:

- [spaCy](https://spacy.io/), which is an open-source software library for Natural Language Processing
- [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html), a python module that implements pseudo-random number generators
- [my_module](my_module.py), which is the main python file that implements the code.

### Installation

**spaCy**: We advise referring to the official documentation regarding proper installation [here](https://spacy.io/usage#installation).

**random**: It is a module present within the Python Standard Library and, therefore, should be present in all standard installation of Python.

**my_module**: It is necessary to download this project and extract it inside your project folder.
